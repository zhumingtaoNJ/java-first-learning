## How to create a jar file

You can create a jar file named after your working folder name

1.) Go to File → Project Structure → Artifacts → JAR → “From modules with dependencies”

2.) Click OK a couple of times

3.) Click Build → Build Artifacts (this will create a JAR file in a folder called “Artifacts”)

4.) Distribute this JAR file to other Java programmers, who can now import it into IntelliJ (or otherwise)

After all, we will use Maven to do all the project management work
