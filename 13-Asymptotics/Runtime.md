# RunTime

Instead of counting the time on a computer, which will be influenced by the complier and other things,
we count the time on paper.

We count the how many operations the porgram does by using the input N.

We will find the most and the least operationg number cost according to the random things in our program.

A better algorithm will have less operations in the worst case than the original one.

## The worst case 

The worst case is the case that the program will do the most operations.

We compute the worst case by using the maximum value of N.

> choose the most cost model

> look at the loop or any other operations

> count the operations using the model by N

> simplify the result to get the worst growth.
